# wine-quality

The winequality Jupyter Notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a DNN neural network to predict wine quality from chemical attributes using scikit-learn, tensorflow and keras. 

The winequalitygan notebook builds a GAN neural network model that generates fake data that looks similar to the wine quality training data using scikit-learn and torch.
