# wine-quality

The winequality Jupyter Notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a DNN neural network to predict wine quality from chemical attributes using scikit-learn, tensorflow and keras.

A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is a class of machine learning frameworks and a prominent framework for approaching generative artificial intelligence. GANs are typically used to generate simulated images that look similar to the training data set, but in this case I created a GAN neural network model that generates fake data that looks similar to the wine quality training data using scikit-learn and torch.
