# wine-quality

The winequality Jupyter Notebook performs exporatory data analysis and builds a DNN neural network to predict wine quality from chemical attributes using scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras. 

The winequalitygan builds a GAN neural network that generates fake data that looks similar to the wine quality training data using scikit-learn and torch.
